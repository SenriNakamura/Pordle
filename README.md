# Pordle

This project was created for my high school's new students, Gr.8 to help them learn their teachers in an interactive, entertaining way.

This project is a wordle inspired game where users guess a name in the tiled boxes. Number of tiles in a row and color cues are used to predict the answer.

This project was incomplete as I was able to obtain permissions from school to create profile images and information of teachers at Point Secondary School.
